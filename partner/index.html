    <p>We at SEP recognize that not all of our local businesses are in a position to financially contribute directly to our organization.  As the economic impact of investments by our SEP clients in the goods and services they need to build their businesses demonstrates (more than $230,000 in SEP’s most recently ended fiscal year), SEP clients prefer to invest locally to meet their needs whenever possible.</p>
    <p>Many local businesses are becoming Sebastopol Entrepreneurs’ Project Partners and extending their support to SEP clients while growing their own businesses.  Whether you are a printer, a web developer, a bookkeeper or accountant, a lawyer, run a commercial kitchen, or provide any of the myriad goods and services businesses depend on, you can help SEP clients get started and, at the same time, build your own stable of dedicated, loyal customers.</p>
    <p>SEP Partners generally provide our clients an initial discount or introductory offer on the goods and services they offer.  They are included on the Partner Listing on the SEP website and are recognized at SEP events and programs.  Please contact Gay McFarren, our Executive Director (gmcfarren@sepyes.com) to discuss becoming a SEP Partner.</p>
