    We have been clients of the Sebastopol Entrepreneur Project for three years - very much to our benefit.  We three mommies took a recipe and started Not Yer Momma's™ Granola in the Sebastopol Farmer's Market with no other business experience and no clue what we were doing.
    Cost analysis? Marketing strategy? Packaging specs? Nutritional analysis? Permits? Long-term strategy and financing?
    Bupkiss. Clueless. Didn't have the tools, and more than that, didn't know what the tools were so we could research and learn them.
    SEP has conducted a rolling program with us that amounts to gaining a practical business degree and we are still in business in large part because of the efforts of our advisers in this organization.

  testimonial: >
    Having an MBA in entrepreneurship and years of experience in corporate
    strategy, I was skeptical that free assistance offered by the community
    would be something more than what I had already learned. But, I have been
    thoroughly impressed. Every time I meet with Kee, I come away with action
    items that are specific and valuable. It’s been helpful as well to have
    the positive encouragement from a proven entrepreneur. I strongly recommend
    an SEP membership to any new local business!
